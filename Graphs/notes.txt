DFS -(V+E)
BFS -(V+E)

Topological Sort - Job sequencing (J2 finishes after J1) 
works on Acyclic Graphs only.


By Bfs - 
Steps-
Give indegree to all the vertex ,
Add vertex with 0 indgree to the queue, 
While processing the vertex decrease the indegree of its adjecents ,
If adjecents indgree is 0 add to queue .

By Dfs -
Idea - use nature of recursion that last reached node will be processed first.
Steps-
Maintain a stack , in which put the element after processing of it's
neighbours is done .
Print the elenets in stack .

Applications of Topological Sort-

We can check for  presence of cycle in undirected graph by bfs topological sort 
step-
Maintain a counter for all the 0 indegree vertice processed .
if the final count is same as the No. of Vertices then cycle is not present.
Idea- 
If a cycle is present then in that cycle Vertices will be depended on each other,
so indegree can't be zero for atleast one of the vertice.
